# Minimum-Spanning-Tree

This code uses the Minimum Spanning Tree Data Structure to organize cities on the miles.dat file according to the distance with respect to each other.
The cities' distances are first inputted into a weighted adjacency matrix. 
Prim's algorithm is then applied to may make the minimum spanning and the total distance is calculated with respect to that.
